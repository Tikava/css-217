 ## Simple library management system based on CLI.
- There are 2 models, e.g: Book, Author. 
- Service package in source directory is reponsible for handling all back-end based operations.
- `facade.py` is responsible for encapsulating all these operations into simple set. Here I used Facade pattern to implement.
